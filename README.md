# generator-esites-fe
Yeoman generator for E-sites projects

## Installation
Make sure Node and npm are installed. A great guide can be found here: [https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

First you need to install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/):

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

After that you'll need to install the generator:
```bash
npm install -g @e-sites/generator-esites-fe
```

If you already have these packages installed, you can upgrade them:
```bash
npm update -g yo @e-sites/generator-esites-fe
```

**Note**: Mac users need to run above commands with `sudo`.
